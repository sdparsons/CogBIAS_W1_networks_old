Readme file for network analysis project


To do:

* Big target - get methods + results ready to share with the group. 

* Fix issue with AIBQ having 2-3 fewer participants than CCBH. (this is because I removed the same aprticipants as in the DPT reduction due to low accuracy. taking out that removal line keeps CCBH and AIBQ at the same n. But, the DPT is still at 448. Making a minor note of this should be ok I think?) 
* reformat code to be more readable
* For the paper
** finish description of the LASSO
** finish the transition from the LASSO to the moderated network
** write the moderated network session





In an ideal world - nitpicky to do

* Extract the edge colours from the moderated network visualisation (Fig 2) and use in figure 3
